        <h2> How Vision-Based Quality Control Works:</h2>
        <p>
          Vision-Based Quality Control combines machine vision, artificial
          intelligence, and automation to inspect products with unmatched
          precision. Hereâ€™s how the process works:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Image Acquisition:</h3></li>
          <p>
            High-resolution cameras capture images or video of the product as it
            moves through the production line. Multiple angles or lighting
            conditions may be used for detailed observation.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Image Processing:</h3></li>
          <p>
            Advanced algorithms process the images, identifying features such as
            size, shape, color, texture, and surface integrity. This step
            converts visual data into actionable insights.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Defect Detection:</h3></li>
          <p>
            AI models analyze the processed images, comparing them to
            pre-defined quality standards. Any deviation, such as scratches,
            dents, misalignments, or irregular dimensions, is flagged as a
            defect.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Classification:</h3></li>
          <p>
            Detected defects are categorized (e.g., minor or critical) for
            appropriate action. This step helps prioritize issues requiring
            immediate attention.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Feedback & Action:</h3></li>
          <p>
            The system sends real-time feedback to production teams or automated
            machinery, allowing defective products to be removed or corrected
            without halting production.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Technologies Used:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>
            Machine Learning Models: Train the system to identify complex
            patterns and defects.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Edge Detection Algorithms: Highlight boundaries and inconsistencies.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Read and verify labels,
            bar-codes, or text on products.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            3D Vision Systems: Analyze dimensions and depth for precise
            inspections.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
